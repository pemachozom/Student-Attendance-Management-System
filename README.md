## 📌 Project Overview

The **Student Attendance Management System** automates the attendance process for both students and lecturers. Key features include:

- 🧑‍🏫 Lecturer login, attendance marking, and editing  
- 👨‍🎓 Student login and attendance viewing  
- 📅 Attendance reports (weekly/monthly)  
- 📢 Notifications for students with < 90% attendance  
- 🔐 Role-based access (Lecturer/Student)

## 🧠 Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton** – For centralized database access  
- **Abstract Factory** – For generating different types of attendance reports  
- **Proxy** – To control and secure access to attendance data  
- **Chain of Responsibility** – For login handling and attendance status updates  
- **Command** – For saving, updating, and editing attendance  
- **Mediator** – For managing student notifications

## 📦 How to Use

1. Compile the source files in a Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ)
2. Run the project or export it as a `.jar` file:
   - `AttendanceManagement.jar`

Lecturers can register, log in, and take/edit attendance, while students can log in to view their attendance reports.
